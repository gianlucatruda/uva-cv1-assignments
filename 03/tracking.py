"""
1. Implement a simple feature-tracking algorithm by following below steps. Name your script tracking.py.

    (a) Locate feature points on the first frame by using the Harris Corner Detector, that you implemented in section 1.

    (b) Track these points using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm for optical flow estimation, that you implemented in section 2.

2. Prepare a video for each sample image sequences. These videos should visualize the initial feature points and the optical flow. Test your imple - mentation and prepare visualization videos for pingpong and person toy samples.
